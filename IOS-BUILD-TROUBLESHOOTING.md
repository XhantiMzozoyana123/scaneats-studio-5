# 🔧 iOS Build Troubleshooting Guide

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Git tag `v1.0.0` created and pushed
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows configured
- ⚠️ Production build failed
- 🔄 Development build triggered

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### 1. Check Build Status
**Go to your GitHub repository:**
https://github.com/XhantiMzozoyana123/scaneats-studio-5/actions

Look for these workflows:
- "Build Development IPA (No Signing)" 
- "Build Production IPA"
- "Simple iOS Build Debug"

### 2. Manual Debug Build
If you want to run a manual debug build:

```bash
# In your repository, go to Actions tab
# Click "Simple iOS Build Debug"
# Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
```

### 3. Common Build Failure Reasons

#### A. Missing iOS Project Setup
```bash
# Fix by re-adding iOS platform
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
```

#### B. Dependencies Issues
```bash
# Fix by reinstalling
npm ci
npx cap sync
```

#### C. Xcode Configuration Issues
- Usually happens in CI environment
- Check if CocoaPods installation fails
- Look for signing/provisioning issues

### 4. Check Build Logs

When a build fails, click on the failed workflow and look for:

**Common Error Patterns:**
- `npm ERR!` - Node.js dependency issues
- `pod install failed` - CocoaPods issues  
- `xcodebuild failed` - Xcode compilation issues
- `No such file or directory` - Missing files

## 🔍 Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify Local Build
```bash
# Test local build first
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

### Step 2: Check iOS Project
```bash
# Make sure iOS project exists
ls ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

### Step 3: Test Simple Build
The "Simple iOS Build Debug" workflow will:
- ✅ Test Node.js setup
- ✅ Test Next.js build  
- ✅ Test Capacitor sync
- ✅ Test basic Xcode build
- ✅ Provide detailed logs

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Build failed because of webpack errors"
**Solution:** 
- AI services not compatible with static export
- Already fixed in your code (server actions disabled)

### Issue 2: "pod install failed"
**Solution:**
- CocoaPods version compatibility
- Usually auto-resolves in CI environment

### Issue 3: "No provisioning profile"
**Solution:**
- Development builds don't need signing
- Production builds need Apple Developer setup

### Issue 4: "Archive failed"
**Solution:**
- Code signing issues
- Use development export instead

## 🚀 Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Use Development Build
Development builds are simpler and more reliable:
- No code signing required
- Faster build times
- Good for testing

### Option B: Simplified Production Build
Create a simpler production workflow:
- Skip complex signing
- Use development export
- Manual signing later

### Option C: Local Xcode Build
If all else fails:
- Use `npm run cap:ios` 
- Build manually in Xcode
- Export IPA from Xcode

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Check the GitHub Actions logs** for specific error messages
2. **Run the debug workflow** to identify the exact issue
3. **Try development build first** before production
4. **Report specific error messages** for targeted help
