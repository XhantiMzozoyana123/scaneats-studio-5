# ðŸ“¦ XCARCHIVE to IPA Conversion Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Does**

Converts your **XCARCHIVE** file from Ionic Appflow into a proper **IPA** file that you can:
- Install on devices (development/ad-hoc)
- Submit to App Store (app-store)
- Distribute internally (enterprise)

## ðŸ†“ **Why Use GitHub Actions?**

- âœ… **Completely FREE** (uses GitHub's macOS runners)
- âœ… **No Mac required** (runs in the cloud)
- âœ… **Automatic Xcode handling** (latest version always)
- âœ… **Professional signing** (same as local Xcode)
- âœ… **Multiple export types** (development, app-store, etc.)

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Get Your XCARCHIVE**
1. Go to [Appflow Builds](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/apps/e0d0cbc9/build/builds)
2. Click on your completed build
3. Download the **XCARCHIVE** file
4. Save it to your project folder

### **Step 2: Run Converter**
```bash
# Simply run this script
.\convert-xcarchive-to-ipa.bat
```

### **Step 3: Choose Export Type**
- **Development**: Testing on your registered devices
- **Ad-hoc**: Beta testing with specific device UDIDs
- **App Store**: Official App Store submission
- **Enterprise**: Internal company distribution

### **Step 4: Download IPA**
- GitHub Actions runs automatically (~5-10 minutes)
- Download IPA from **Artifacts** section
- Install or submit as needed!

## ðŸ”§ **Export Types Explained**

| Type | Use Case | Signing | Installation |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Development** | Testing on your devices | Development cert | Xcode, AltStore, Sideloadly |
| **Ad-hoc** | Beta testing (limited devices) | Distribution cert | TestFlight alternative |
| **App Store** | Official App Store | Distribution cert | App Store Connect |
| **Enterprise** | Internal company apps | Enterprise cert | Internal distribution |

## ðŸ“‹ **What The Workflow Does**

1. âœ… **Sets up macOS environment** with latest Xcode
2. âœ… **Extracts your XCARCHIVE** (handles zipped files too)
3. âœ… **Creates ExportOptions.plist** (export configuration)
4. âœ… **Runs xcodebuild -exportArchive** (converts to IPA)
5. âœ… **Uploads IPA as artifact** (easy download)
6. âœ… **Creates release** (for app-store builds)

## ðŸŽ¯ **File Structure**

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ YourApp.xcarchive          # From Appflow
â”œâ”€â”€ convert-xcarchive-to-ipa.bat  # Converter script
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ export-ipa.yml         # GitHub Actions workflow
â””â”€â”€ output/                    # Generated IPAs
    â”œâ”€â”€ YourApp.ipa           # Your final IPA!
    â””â”€â”€ logs/                 # Build logs
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

### **For App Store Submission:**
1. Use **"app-store"** export method
2. Ensure you have Distribution Certificate
3. Upload IPA to App Store Connect
4. Configure app metadata and submit for review

### **For Device Testing:**
1. Use **"development"** export method  
2. Install with AltStore, Sideloadly, or Xcode
3. Perfect for testing before App Store submission

### **For Beta Testing:**
1. Use **"ad-hoc"** export method
2. Register tester device UDIDs in Apple Developer
3. Great alternative to TestFlight

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **"No XCARCHIVE found"**
- Make sure you downloaded the XCARCHIVE from Appflow
- Place it in the same folder as the script
- File should end with `.xcarchive`

### **"Export failed"**
- Check you have proper certificates in Apple Developer
- Verify Bundle ID matches your app configuration
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error

### **"IPA won't install"**
- Development builds: Register device UDID in Apple Developer
- App Store builds: Use App Store Connect, not direct install
- Ad-hoc builds: Add device UDID to provisioning profile

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success!**

Once complete, you'll have a professional IPA file ready for:
- âœ… Device installation
- âœ… App Store submission  
- âœ… Beta distribution
- âœ… Enterprise deployment
